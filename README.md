Brute-Force-Method-Planning-Automobile-Production
This project presents a brute-force optimization model in Python to solve a real-world automobile production planning problem. Using a combinatorial approach, the model evaluates all feasible combinations of production and delivery plans to satisfy customer orders while considering delivery deadlines and plant capacity constraints.

📌 Objective
To explore the feasibility and computational trade-offs of a brute-force algorithm when solving a scheduling and delivery planning problem in the automotive industry.

🛠️ Key Features
Brute-force exploration of all valid production plans.

Constraints:

Production capacities per month.

Delivery deadlines per product/customer.

Evaluation of feasible solutions and output of optimal or near-optimal plans.

Fully written in Python using NumPy and Pandas.

Transparent and modifiable logic, ideal for educational or prototyping purposes.

📂 Structure
Exercise_Automobiles_Solution_CC.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, constraints, logic, and outputs.

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository.

Open the notebook with Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run the cells to explore how the brute-force method generates and tests all valid production scenarios.

📈 Sample Output
A valid production schedule that satisfies all delivery deadlines.

Insight into the limitations and computational cost of brute-force algorithms in real-world contexts.

🧠 Use Cases
Educational demonstration of brute-force methods.

Baseline prototype for more advanced heuristics or optimization solvers.

Exploratory planning tool when problem size is manageable.
